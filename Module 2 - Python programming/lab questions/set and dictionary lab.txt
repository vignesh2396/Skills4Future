dictionary

1. create a dictionary from the following two lists:
keys = ['one','two','three']
values = [1,2,3]

2. create a dictionary for n students in a class with roll number as key, name and marks as values and display the names of students who have marks above 75.

3. write a program to print the maximum, minimun, sum of keys as well as values of numbers dictionary as given below.
numbers = {1:111, 2:222, 3:333, 4:444} 

4. You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a dictionary. The keys in student_scores are the names of the students and the values are their exam scores.

Write a program that converts their scores to grades. By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary called student_grades that should contain student names for keys and their grades for values. The final version of the student_grades dictionary will be checked.

This is the scoring criteria:

Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"

Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"

Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"

Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"
