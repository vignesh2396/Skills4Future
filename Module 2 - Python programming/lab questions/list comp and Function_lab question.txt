list comprehension questions

print the numbers in 'range(1000)' that are even and contain the digit '9' using list comprehension.
 
convert a list of strings to integers using list comprehension.
eg: input - ['1','23','35','64'] output - [1,23,35,64]

using list comprehension non vowel characters in the string to '*'
eg: input - 'apple' output - 'a***e' 

sort this list [[3,2,5],[4,3,10],[3,9,2]] in ascending order using list comprehension.
output - [[2,3,5],[3,4,10],[2,3,9]]

Functions questions

Write a Ceasar Cipher Encryption and Decryption program 
#TODO-1: What if the user enters a shift that is greater than the number of letters in the alphabet?
  #Try running the program and entering a shift number of 45.
  #Add some code so that the program continues to work even if the user enters a shift number greater than 26. 
  #Hint: Think about how you can use the modulus (%).

#TODO-2: Can you figure out a way to ask the user if they want to restart the cipher program?
#e.g. Type 'yes' if you want to go again. Otherwise type 'no'.
#If they type 'yes' then ask them for the direction/text/shift again and call the caesar() function again?
#Hint: Try creating a while loop that continues to execute the program if the user types 'yes'.
